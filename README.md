# Darling and Mason Premiere Salon

This is a static website that I designed for a local salon.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML & CSS

I created this site from scratch without the help of any frameworks - it's pure HTML and CSS. I designed the site with high contrast colors in mind for visual accessibility. I also made sure to label everything for optimum readability by screen readers.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

Once I was finished with the prototype, I refactored it to greatly reduced load times. I accomplished this by redesigning the logo using pure HTML/CSS and converting all of the images into webp format.

## Lessons Learned:

During the design and building of this site, I learned that it's more efficient to design for mobile first to get all of the key elements into the site and then build up to larger format screens.
